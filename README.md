# MQTT-Reader

Welcome to the **MQTT-Reader** repository! This project demonstrates how to set up and interact with MQTT using a local Mosquitto broker running in Docker. It includes four services within Docker containers: the Mosquitto broker, a data publishing service, a data subscribing service, and a Python application.
